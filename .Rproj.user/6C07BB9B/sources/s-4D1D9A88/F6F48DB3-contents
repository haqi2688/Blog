Today let's talk about flowers. My favorite flower is the lavender because it smells really nice and it is calming. What's yours? 

Let's create a list of my favorite flowers using python:
```{python}
import numpy as np
flowers=np.array(["lavender","daisy","sunflower","lotus"])
```
Oh but I also like [wisteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria)! Let's add that in using R:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
py$flowers[5]<-"wisteria"
py$flowers
```
