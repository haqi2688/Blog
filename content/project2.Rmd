## Yu Qin 

This is a document exploring vaccination in schools, with an interest to see if there is a difference in measles vaccination rates between public and private schools. The dataset includes the US state the school is located in (**state**), the category of school (**type**), private or public, the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination rate for the school (**mmr**), enrollment number of the school (**enroll**), and medical vaccination exemption rate in the school (**xmed**). Data was obtained from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday, with original source from The Wallstreet Journal. The dataset, after removing unusable observations, contains 10202 observations. When all NA's are removed, the dataset contains 6244 observations.

I am interested in seeing if difference in policies between private, charter, and public schools will show in their MMR vaccination rates becuase the outbreak of measles typically center around schools. I suspect that public school may have better measles vaccination due to stricter government regulation.  

```{r}
measles<-readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-25/measles.csv')
measles<-measles%>%
  select(index,name,state,type,enroll,mmr,xmed)%>%
  filter(mmr>0,enroll>0)%>%unique()%>%
  filter(!type=="Kindergarten")%>%
  mutate(y=ifelse(type=="Public",1,0))%>%
  select(state,type,enroll,mmr,xmed,y)
```

I created a binary variable y where 1=public school and 0=charter and private schools. Since charter schools are selective and not governed by the ISD, and do not have to abide by state laws, they are more similar in policy to private schools, which is why I grouped them together. 

```{r}
mman<-manova(cbind(enroll,mmr,xmed)~type, data=measles)
summary(mman)
summary.aov(mman)
pairwise.t.test(measles$enroll,measles$type, p.adj="none")
pairwise.t.test(measles$mmr,measles$type, p.adj="none")
pairwise.t.test(measles$xmed,measles$type,p.adj="none")
0.05/13
```

I did 1 MANOVA, 3 ANOVAs, and 9 t-tests for a total of 13 hypothesis tests, so with type-I error rate at 0.05 (alpha), the boneferroni adjusted significance level should be 0.003846154. At this significance level, public and charter schools do not differ in medical exemption rate, but private and charter schools as well as private and public schools differ significantly. Private and charter, private and public, and public and charter, all differ in enrollment. Similarly, private and charter, private and public, and public and charter, all differ in MMR vaccination rate as well. 

Because these data were collected intentionally from as many schools as possible, the samples were not at random. Multivariate normality is most likely not met, but n>25 for each group. Homogeneity is likely not met since there is probably unequal covariance between the dependent variables. There is also probably no linear relationship the dependent variables (such as enrollment and MMR vaccination). There are probably no extreme univariate or multivariate outliers in the dataset, and probably no multicollinearity. 

```{r}
rand_dist<-vector()
for(i in 1:5000){
new<-data.frame(mmr=sample(measles$mmr),
                type=measles$y)
rand_dist[i]<-mean(new[new$type==1,]$mmr)-
  mean(new[new$type==0,]$mmr)
}
measles%>%group_by(y)%>%summarize(mean=mean(mmr))%>%
                            summarize(diff(mean))
mean(rand_dist>3.302014|rand_dist< -3.302014)
ggplot()+geom_histogram(aes(rand_dist))+
          xlab("Difference in mean MMR")
```

In a randomized sample,the null hypothesis is that the public schools do not differ from non-public school (charter, private) in MMR vaccination rates. The alternative hypothesis is that public schools do have different MMR vaccination rates than non-public schools. The true mean difference is 3.302014 between public and non-public schools, and the calculated p-value for randomized sample is 0. The null is rejected, which means that there is a difference in MMR vaccination rate between public and non-public schools. From the histogram, we can see that all of the mean differences from the randomized sample fall between -1 and 1, far from the true mean difference. 

```{r}
measles1<-measles
measles1$enroll_c<-measles$enroll-mean(measles$enroll)
measles1$xmed_c<-measles$xmed-mean(measles$xmed,na.rm=T)
fit<-lm(mmr~enroll_c*type, data=measles1)
summary(fit)
```
Predicted MMR vaccination rate for charter schools when enrollment is average is 89.52653. MMR vaccination rate increases 0.05937 percentage in charter schools for every 1-person increase in enrollment on average. When enrollment is average, the MMR vaccination rate for private schools is 3.98309 higher than charter schools. When enrollement is average, the MMR vaccination rate for public schools is 5.20283 higher than charter schools. The slope for enrollment on MMR vaccination rate is -0.03598 lower for private schools compared to charter schools. The slope for enrollment on MMR vaccination rate is -0.05596 lower for public schools compared to charter schools. This model explains approximately 2.8% of variability in MMR vaccination rate. 

```{r}
ggplot(measles,aes(enroll,mmr,color=type))+
  geom_smooth(method="lm",alpha=0.2)+
  xlab("Enrollment (persons)")+
  ylab("MMR Vaccination Rate (%)")+
  ggtitle("Regression Plot")
```

The regression line for private schools extend beyond 100% vaccination rate, which is impossible. 

```{r}
ggplot(measles,aes(enroll,mmr,color=type))+geom_point(alpha=0.2)
```

From the scatter plot we see that the variables are not linear in relationship. 

```{r}
bptest(fit)
```

Presence of heteroskedasticity. 

```{r}
ks.test(fit$residuals,"pnorm",mean=0, sd(fit$residuals))
```

True distribution **NOT** normal.

```{r}

```

After using robust standard errors, the coefficients did not change but the standard errors both had increases (enroll_c,enroll_c:typePrivate,enroll_c:typePublic) and decreases (intercept,typePrivate,typePublic). Accordingly, the p-values also changed but the significance remained the same. There remains a significant effect on MMR vaccination rate by enrollement change and the difference in MMR vaccination rate (when controlled for enrollment) between charter and private and charter and public also remains significant. Interactions of enrollment with type of school also stayed significant. 

```{r}
samp_distn<-replicate(5000, {
boot_dat <- sample_frac(measles1, replace=T) 
fit <- lm(mmr~enroll_c*type, data=boot_dat) 
coef(fit) 
})
samp_distn%>%t%>%as.data.frame%>%summarize_all(sd)
samp_distn%>%t%>%as.data.frame%>%gather%>%group_by(key)%>%
  summarize(lower=quantile(value,0.025),upper=quantile(value,0.975))
```

The bootstrapped SEs are very close and similar to the robust SEs in values, and just like robust SEs, there are increases (enroll_c,enroll_c:typePrivate,enroll_c:typePublic) and decreases (intercept,typePrivate,typePublic) from the original SEs. 

None of the 95% confidence intervals include 0 between the lower and upper bounds, meaning that all the effects and interactions are significant, which did not change between the other models (original and robust SE).

```

The odds of predicting public school when enrollment, MMR vaccination rate, and medical exemption rate are all average is 70.4971125. Controlling for enrollment and medical exemption rate, for every additional percentage in MMR vaccination rate, the odds of predicting public school increases by a factor of 0.9822358. Controlling for MMR vaccination rate and medical exemption rate, for every additional enrollment, the odds of predicting public school increases by a factor of 1.0588744. Controlling for MMR vaccinatio rate and MMR vaccination rate, for every additional percentage in medical expemtion, the odds of predicting public school increases by a factor of 0.9529549.

The accuracy or proportion of correctly predicted cases is 0.8752402, which is pretty high. The sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR) is 0.9570611, the proportion of public schools correctly classified as public schools.This is really high. The specificity or true negative rate (TNR) is 0.4482072, the proportion of non-public schools (charter, private) correctly classified as non-public schools. This is relatively low. The precision or positive predictive value (PPV) is 0.9005207, the proportion of actual public schools that were classified/predicted as public schools. This is pretty high.

The calculated AUC (area under curve) is 0.888229, which is good (0.8-0.9). This means that the probability that a randomly selected public school has a higher predicted probability than a randomly selected non-public school is 0.888229.

10-fold CV LASSO for continuous response variable, mmr. Residual standard error (RMSE) is 6.765. Compared to the RMSE from the model without LASSO, the RMSE for the model with LASSO is actually larger but not by much. This means that both model's fit is about the same.
