### About
![](/./about_files/DSCN7475.JPEG)
Hi! I'm Haity. 
I am a soon-to-be graduate of The University of Texas at Austin. My degree is in Human Biology and Neuroscience. I do a lot of research but aside from that, I also like to take landscape pictures. Come check out my Instagram!

I also really like pandas, and can recognize them by name.
